# Workout To do List


https://github.com/MikeVita4/CPSC4125_Montiel_lab1


The website has a prepopulated list of options, the user can choose to keep or delete them.

The way deletion works, is that every listed item works as a link/button, where you can click it, and it will automatically delete.
This way you avoid extra steps.

To add, simple type the workout you plan on doing, and it'll add it.
To make it easier, it'll also clear the input box for ease of use.
It will check if there is input, therefore avoiding empty lists.

The project accomplishes the goal of deletion and selection, input, and addition.
